The true or false answers for each statement along with corrections for the false statements:

(a) Object-oriented programming permits reusability of the existing code.
      True

(b) Languages earlier than procedural programming languages made use of only global variables.
      False
Correct Statement: Languages earlier than procedural programming languages often used global variables extensively, but they also had local variables in some cases. For instance, early assembly languages and some early high-level languages did support local variables.

(c) It is easier to write, understand and maintain programs if they use Object-Oriented programming model as compared to Structured programming model.
       True

(d) As compared to procedures, data is not given enough importance in Procedural programming.
    True

(e) Structured programming model does not represent the real world problem as well as the Object-oriented programming model
     True

(f) A class permits us to build user-defined data types.
      True

(g) Encapsulation facilitates a single function name to be used for the same operation performed on related derived classes.
       False
 Correct Statement: Polymorphism, not encapsulation, facilitates a single function name to be used for the same operation performed on related derived classes.

(h) In polymorphism even though the function names are same, their implementation may vary from class to class.
      True

(i) Multiple objects can be created from the same class.
     True

(j) Object-oriented Programming paradigm stresses on dividing the logic into smaller parts and writing procedures for each part.
      False
 Correct Statement: The Object-Oriented Programming paradigm stresses on encapsulating data and behavior into objects rather than simply dividing logic into smaller parts, which is a characteristic of Structured Programming.

(k) Classes and objects are cornerstones of structured programming paradigm.
        False
Correct Statement:- Classes and objects are cornerstones of the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm, not the Structured Programming paradigm.

(l) Object-oriented programming paradigm gives equal importance to data and the procedures that work on the data.
      True

(m) Java is a structured programming language.
     False
  Correct Statement: Java is an Object-Oriented Programming language, though it also supports structured programming principles.
